# boids
Non-complete boids simulation I did to get more familiar with OOP, instances do not avoid each other or attempt cohesion.  
Now that I have written it, I have some ideas for optimisation, and being a little clever with the math might make it run faster as well, but I will rewrite it in C++ if I intend to do a faster version.
