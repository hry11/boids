# boids
Boids simulation I did to get more familiar with OOP, instances align with each other, try not to get separated and avoid collision.    
Now that I have written it, I have some ideas for optimisation, and being a little clever with the math might make it run faster as well, but I will rewrite it in C++ if I intend to do a faster version.
